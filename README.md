## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to load image"**: Ensure the image path contains no special characters
2. **Video doesn't play**: Some media players struggle with OpenCV output. Try VLC or import directly into video editing software
3. **Memory errors with large images**: Resize images to reasonable dimensions (e.g., 1920x1080) before processing
